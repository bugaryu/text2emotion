"うとうととして目がさめると女はいつのまにか、隣のじいさんと話を始めている。
このじいさんはたしかに前の前の駅から乗ったいなか者である。
発車まぎわに頓狂な声を出して駆け込んで来て、いきなり肌をぬいだと思ったら背中にお灸のあとがいっぱいあったので、三四郎の記憶に残っている。
じいさんが汗をふいて、肌を入れて、女の隣に腰をかけたまでよく注意して見ていたくらいである。
女とは京都からの相乗りである。","When she woke up from a doze, she found herself talking with the old man next to her.
The old man was indeed a rickshaw rider who had boarded the train from the station in front of her.
He came running in with a crazy voice just as the train was about to depart, and when he suddenly took off his skin, Sanshiro remembered that his back was covered with the marks of moxibustion.
He had to watch carefully until his grandfather wiped off his sweat, put his skin back on, and sat down next to the woman.
He and the woman were sharing a ride from Kyoto.",0.0,0.0,0.17,0.17,0.67
"乗った時から三四郎の目についた。
第一色が黒い。
三四郎は九州から山陽線に移って、だんだん京大阪へ近づいて来るうちに、女の色が次第に白くなるのでいつのまにか故郷を遠のくような哀れを感じていた。
それでこの女が車室にはいって来た時は、なんとなく異性の味方を得た心持ちがした。
この女の色はじっさい九州色であった。","From the moment he got in the car, Sanshiro's eyes caught his attention.
Her first color was black.
As Sanshiro moved from Kyushu to the Sanyo Line and gradually approached Kyoto-Osaka, the woman's color gradually became whiter, and he felt a sense of sorrow as if he were leaving his hometown behind.
When this woman came into the car, I felt as if I had found an ally of the opposite sex.

ただ顔だちからいうと、この女のほうがよほど上等である。","She is the same color as Omitsu-san of Miwada.
Until just before she left Japan, Omitsu-san was a noisy woman.
She was very grateful to be away from my side.
However, when I look at it this way, I realize that being like her is not so bad at all.

その寝ているあいだに女とじいさんは懇意になって話を始めたものとみえる。","Sometimes his eyes would meet with the woman's. When he sat down next to the woman, he would watch her for as long as possible.
When my grandfather sat down next to the woman, he would watch her for as long as possible, paying the most attention to her.
At that time, the woman smiled, said, ""Take a seat,"" and gave up her seat to Grandpa.
After a while, Sanshiro became sleepy and fell asleep.

子供の玩具はやっぱり広島より京都のほうが安くっていいものがある。
京都でちょっと用があって降りたついでに、蛸薬師のそばで玩具を買って来た。","Sanshiro opened his eyes and listened to them in silence.

戦争が済んでからいったん帰って来た。
まもなくあっちのほうが金がもうかるといって、また大連へ出かせぎに行った。","She is happy to return to her country and see her children after a long absence.
However, she is worried because her husband's remittances have been cut off and she has no choice but to return to her parents' hometown.
My husband had been working as a naval engineer in Kure for a long time, but during the war he went to Lushun.

不実な性質ではないから、大丈夫だけれども、いつまでも遊んで食べているわけにはゆかないので、安否のわかるまではしかたがないから、里へ帰って待っているつもりだ。
じいさんは蛸薬師も知らず、玩具にも興味がないとみえて、はじめのうちはただはいはいと返事だけしていたが、旅順以後急に同情を催して、それは大いに気の毒だと言いだした。
自分の子も戦争中兵隊にとられて、とうとうあっちで死んでしまった。
いったい戦争はなんのためにするものだかわからない。","In the beginning, I was happy to hear from him and he sent me monthly bills, but for the past six months or so, he has not sent me any letters or money.
But for the past six months or so, I have not received any letters or money. I am not unfaithful, so I am fine, but I can't keep playing and eating.
Grandpa had never heard of an octopus medicine man, nor did he seem to be interested in toys, so at first he simply replied, ""Yes, yes, yes.

If we wait a little longer, I am sure he will come back.

Perhaps it was because the sun had set.

He looked down, poked his chopsticks into his mouth and took two or three bites, but the woman did not seem to be going back to her seat.
He looked up and saw that she was still standing in front of him.

It sounded like the kind of thing you would expect from a child who is not a gung-ho person, but Yoshiko's meaning went a little deeper.

「おっかさんのいうことはなるべく聞いてあげるがよい。近ごろの青年は我々時代の青年と違って自我の意識が強すぎていけない。我々の書生をしているころには、する事なす事一として他を離れたことはなかった。すべてが、君とか、親とか、国とか、社会とか、みんな他本位であった。それを一口にいうと教育を受けるものがことごとく偽善家であった。その偽善が社会の変化で、とうとう張り通せなくなった結果、漸々自己本位を思想行為の上に輸入すると、今度は我意識が非常に発展しすぎてしまった。昔の偽善家に対して、今は露悪家ばかりの状態にある。――君、露悪家という言葉を聞いたことがありますか」,"Listen to your mother as much as you can. Unlike the youth of our time, the youth of these days are not overly self-conscious. When I was a student, I never did anything apart from what I was doing. Everything we did was based on others, whether it was you, our parents, the country, or society. To put it simply, everyone who received an education was a hypocrite. As a result of the changes in society, this hypocrisy finally became untenable, and the self-oriented mindset was gradually imported into the ideological process, but this time, the sense of self became too developed. Whereas hypocrites of the past, we now have only dewbags. --Have you ever heard of the word ""rascals""?",0.1,0.1,0.1,0.3,0.4

"「今ぼくが即席に作った言葉だ。君もその露悪家の一人――だかどうだか、まあたぶんそうだろう。与次郎のごときにいたるとその最たるものだ。あの君の知ってる里見という女があるでしょう。あれも一種の露悪家で、それから野々宮の妹ね、あれはまた、あれなりに露悪家だから面白い。昔は殿様と親父だけが露悪家ですんでいたが、今日では各自同等の権利で露悪家になりたがる。もっとも悪い事でもなんでもない。臭いものの蓋をとれば肥桶で、見事な形式をはぐとたいていは露悪になるのは知れ切っている。形式だけ見事だって面倒なばかりだから、みんな節約して木地だけで用を足している。はなはだ痛快である。天醜爛漫としている。ところがこの爛漫が度を越すと、露悪家同志がお互いに不便を感じてくる。その不便がだんだん高じて極端に達した時利他主義がまた復活する。それがまた形式に流れて腐敗するとまた利己主義に帰参する。つまり際限はない。我々はそういうふうにして暮らしてゆくものと思えばさしつかえない。そうしてゆくうちに進歩する。英国を見たまえ。この両主義が昔からうまく平衡がとれている。だから動かない。だから進歩しない。イブセンも出なければニイチェも出ない。気の毒なものだ。自分だけは得意のようだが、はたから見れば堅くなって、化石しかかっている。……」
三四郎は内心感心したようなものの、話がそれてとんだところへ曲がって、曲がりなりに太くなってゆくので、少し驚いていた。
すると広田さんもようやく気がついた。","I just made that up. You are one of those rascals - or maybe you are, I don't know. You are one of those rascals, or maybe you are. You know that Satomi woman, right? She is also a kind of a rascal, and then there is Nonomiya's sister, who is also a rascal in her own way, so she is interesting. In the old days, only the lord and the father could be a scoundrel, but today, everyone wants to be a scoundrel with equal rights. It's not a bad thing or anything. If you take the lid off the stinky thing, it's a vat of manure, and it's no secret that if you strip off the glamorous formality, you usually end up being a scoundrel. Even if the formality is superb, it is still a hassle, so everyone saves money and uses only wood for their work. It's quite a sight to behold. It's a natural and ugly scene. However, when this extravagance goes too far, the rascals begin to feel inconvenienced by each other. When this inconvenience becomes too much and reaches an extreme, altruism is revived. When it becomes corrupted by formality, it returns to egoism. In other words, there is no limit. We can safely assume that this is how we live our lives. As we do so, we will progress. Look at England. These two principles have always been well balanced. That is why they do not move. That is why there is no progress. If there is no Ibsen, there is no Nietsche. It's a pity. Only you seem to be good at it, but from the outside you can see that you have hardened and are on the verge of fossilization. ......""

ここまでの理屈は三四郎にもわかっている。
けれども三四郎にとって、目下痛切な問題は、だいたいにわたっての理屈ではない。","They would never do that. Likewise, not a single one of those who say, ""I'm laughing my belly off,"" or ""I'm rolling over laughing,"" is actually laughing. The same is true of kindness. Some people do kindness for a job. It's like me being a teacher in a school.

それがすこぶる楽天の趣がある。","In other words, ""Do hypocrisy with deception. You still don't get it, do you? I'm not explaining myself very well. --In the old days, hypocrites were always motivated by the desire to make people feel good about everything. But the opposite is true: they go to great lengths to offend people's impressions of them. Whether viewed horizontally or vertically, the hypocrisy is made to look like hypocrisy to the other person. The other person, of course, feels uncomfortable. But the person's goal is achieved. The honesty with which he tries to make hypocrisy work for the other party as it is is a characteristic of the rascal, and since the language of action on the surface must be good, it is, indeed, a kind of ""two-in-one"" situation. It seems that there are more and more people who skillfully use this method in recent years.

答はなかった。
美禰子はじっとしている。","So, why did I choose Satomi's eyes? Well, I will tell you. When you look at the faces of women in Western paintings, no matter who drew them, they all have big eyes. They are so big that it's ridiculous. In Japan, however, the Kannon, Otafuku, masks of Noh plays, and most strikingly, the beauties in ukiyoe prints are all thin. They all resemble elephants. One might wonder why the standards of beauty are so different between East and West. In fact, it is nothing. In the West, there are only those with large eyes, so aesthetic selection is carried out among those with large eyes. Japan is full of whales--a man named Pierrochette is wondering how the Japanese can open their eyes like that. --Well, because of this, it is impossible to develop an aesthetic eye for large eyes with little material to work with. The ideal of the narrow eye, which allows for freedom of choice, was created and is prized by artists such as Utamaro and Sukenobu. However, no matter how Japanese it may be, in Western painting, such a narrow eye is not appropriate, as it looks like a blind eye. In fact, there is nothing like Raphael's Madonna, and even if there were, it would not be considered Japanese, which is why it bothered Mr. Satomi so much. Satomi-san, you're almost there.
