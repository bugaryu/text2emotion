"僕は或初夏の午後、谷崎氏と神田をひやかしに出かけた。
谷崎氏はその日も黒背広に赤い襟飾りを結んでゐた。
僕はこの壮大なる襟飾りに、象徴せられたるロマンティシズムを感じた。","One early summer afternoon, Mr. Tanizaki and I went out to Kanda for a night of fun.
Mr. Tanizaki was wearing a black suit with a red collar.
I felt the romanticism symbolized by this magnificent collar.",0.38,0.12,0.0,0.38,0.12

が、道行きは茶の湯の師匠も菩提寺の和尚も着るものである。
衆俗の目を駭かすことは到底一輪の紅薔薇に似た、非凡なる襟飾りに及ぶ筈はない。","I had borrowed my father's traveling coat instead of a summer cloak.
But the doyuki was worn by both the masters of the tea ceremony and the priests of the family temple.
It would never be as eye-catching to the masses as an extraordinary lapel ornament that resembled a single red rose.",0.4,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.2

Soon after, we sat down in a kaffee in Ura-Jimbocho.
We were thirsty and decided to have a soda or something.",0.17,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.5

コツプは真理のやうに澄んだ水に細かい泡を躍らせてゐた。","After ordering my drink, I continued to watch the beacon of romanticism burning in Mr. Tanizaki's throat.
